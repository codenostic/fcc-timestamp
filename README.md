TimeStamp Microservice
=========================

Click `Show` in the header to see app live. 

Objective
------------

- check for valid date in unix or natural date format
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
